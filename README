LSB configuration for buildbot
------------------------------

The current buildbot settings and scripts are stored here.  There are
currently two types of files here:

 - master.cfg, the master configuration for buildbot

 - the files in slavescripts, which are expected to be copied to every
   build slave somewhere in the PATH

The setup procedure for completely rebuilding the buildbot config is
as follows:

1.  On the master, set up buildbot and create a master according to
the directions in the documentation.

2.  Copy or symlink master.cfg from this project as the master.cfg for
the new master.

3.  Install the tools needed for building all projects in the SDK on
the slaves.  At minimum, that will include bzr.

4,  Set up buildbot on the slave, and create a slave instance
according to the buildbot documentation.

5.  Give password-less access via sudo to /usr/bin/rpm for the
buildbot user.  The builds will require the buildbot to install and
remove packages.

6.  Copy the scripts in this project's "slavescripts" directory into
the path.

At that point, you should be able to start both the master and the
slaves.  Force each job, or let them run as scheduled, to make sure
you didn't miss anything.
